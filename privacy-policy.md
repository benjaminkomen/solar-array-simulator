# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 25, 2026

Solar Array Simulator ("the App") is developed by Benjamin Komen. This policy describes how the App handles your data.

## Data Collection

The App does **not** collect, store, or share any personal information. There are no user accounts, analytics, tracking, or advertising.

## Photos

The App allows you to select photos from your device's photo library or take photos with your camera. Photos are used solely to help you design a solar panel layout. Selected photos are:

- Stored locally on your device only.
- Optionally sent to a cloud-based AI service (Amazon Bedrock / Anthropic Claude) for roof analysis, if you choose to use the analysis feature. Photos sent for analysis are processed in real time and are not stored by the App on any server.

Refer to [Anthropic's usage policy](https://www.anthropic.com/policies) and [AWS's privacy notice](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/) for how these third-party services handle data sent to them.

## Local Storage

All configuration and layout data is stored locally on your device using on-device storage. None of this data leaves your device unless you explicitly use the AI analysis feature described above.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services when you opt into AI-powered analysis:

- **Amazon Bedrock (Anthropic Claude)** — for analyzing roof photos. Only the photo you select is sent; no other personal data is transmitted.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

Updates to this policy will be posted on this page with a revised date.
